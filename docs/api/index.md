# Introduction to AI-VERDE API

AI-VERDE exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so any tool or library that supports OpenAI can connect to it using your AI-VERDE API key. This section explains how to get your key and use it across a range of environments.

## Getting Started

Before using the API you will need to:

1. **Obtain your API key** — Sign in at [chat.cyverse.ai](https://chat.cyverse.ai), open your course or team details, and copy the key from the **API Key** tab. See [Obtaining your AI-VERDE API Key](api-token.md) for step-by-step instructions.
2. **Know which models are available** — Your available models are listed on the same API Key page. You can also retrieve them programmatically; see [Getting a List of Models](api-key-models.md).

## Base URL and Authentication

All AI-VERDE API endpoints use the same base URL and bearer-token authentication pattern as OpenAI. When configuring a client, set:

- **Base URL**: `https://api.cyverse.ai/` (or the URL shown in your course details)
- **API Key**: the key you copied from the AI-VERDE dashboard
